	  Choose this option if you have a Microchip SoC with a GFX2D GPU
	  (i.e. SAM9X60 or SAM9X7 families). The GFX2D supports basic 2D
	  graphics instructions, each working on a single rectangle defined
	  by its width and height plus the coordinates of its top-left
	  corner in each of the surface (behind a DRM GEM object) involved
	  in the graphics instructions. There are four types of graphics
	  instructions:
	  - FILL: the rectangle is filled in the target surface with a
	  uniform color.
	  - COPY: the rectangle is copied from a single source surface into
	  the target surface.
	  - BLEND: the rectangle in the target surface is the result of a
	  blending from rectangles of the same size in two source surfaces.
	  - ROP: the rectangle in the target surface is the result of a
	  raster operation on two (ROP2), three (ROP3), or four (ROP4)
	  source surfaces, depending on the selected raster mode.
