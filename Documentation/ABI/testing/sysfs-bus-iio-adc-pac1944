What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/in_currentY_shunt_resistor
KernelVersion:	6.12
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		The value of the shunt resistor may be known only at runtime
		and set by a client application. This attribute allows to
		set its value in micro-ohms. X is the IIO index of the device.
		Y is the channel number. The value is used to calculate
		current, power and accumulated energy.

KernelVersion:	6.12
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Number of consecutive samples exceeding the overcurrent limit
		that are required to trigger the ALERT function for channel Y.
		Consecutive sample count to trigger could be:
			- 1 sample (default),
			- 4 samples,
			- 8 samples,

Description:
		Number of consecutive samples exceeding the undercurrent limit
		that are required to trigger the ALERT function for
		channel Y. Consecutive sample count to trigger could be:
			- 1 sample (default),

Description:
		Number of consecutive samples exceeding the overpower limit that
		are required to trigger the ALERT function for channel Y.
		Consecutive sample count to trigger could be:

Description:
		Number of consecutive samples exceeding the overvoltage limit
		that are required to trigger the ALERT function for channel Y.
		Consecutive sample count to trigger could be:
			- 1 sample (default),
			- 4 samples,
			- 8 samples,

KernelVersion:	6.12
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Number of consecutive samples exceeding the undervoltage limit
		that are required to trigger the ALERT function for channel Y.
		Consecutive sample count to trigger could be:

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/in_acc_fullness
KernelVersion:	6.12
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		A read/write property used to set a limit for how full the
		Accumulators and Accumulator Count registers can be before the
		Accumulator Full and Accumulator Count full limits are tripped.
		This allows an ALERT to be registered when the Accumulator and
		Accumulator Count are approaching 100% full.
		The fullness limit could be set to:
			- full,
			- 15/16 full (default),
			- 7/8 full,
			- 3/4 full

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/alert_enable
KernelVersion:	6.12
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		A read/write property used to enable/disable the limits events
		and also controls the signals triggered when the Accumulator for
		any channel overflows or exceeds its fullness or the Accumulator
		Count overflows or exceeds its fullness limit.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/slow_alert1
KernelVersion:	6.12
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		A read/write property used to route a specific ALERT signal to
		the SLOW/ALERT1 pin. The SLOW/ALERT1 pin must be configured for
		the ALERT function in order to control the device hardware pin
		(this is the default functionality of the device hardware pin).

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/gpio_alert2
KernelVersion:	6.12
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		A read/write property used to route a specific ALERT signal to
		to the GPIO/ALERT2 pin. The GPIO/ALERT2 pin must be configured
		for ALERT function in order to control the device hardware pin
		(this is the default functionality of the device hardware pin).

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/out_alert_status
KernelVersion:	6.12
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		A read only property used to determine the cause of ALERT/events
		being tripped.
